Problem1: You are given an array A[], Consisting of N non-negative integers. 
	  Now you need to answer Q queries of the following types, given an integer K in each query.

	  You need to find the minimum length L of any subarray of A,
	  Such that if all elements of this sub array are represented in Binary Notation and Concatenated to form
	  binary string, then number of one's in the resulting string is alteast K

Problem2: Suppose you are given an array A[1..n] of sorted integers that has been circularly shifted k positions 
	  to the right. for example A[32,34,5,15,27,29] is sorted array that has been circularly shifted k=2 positions
	  while A[27,29,32,34,5,15] has been shifted k=4 positions.
	  We can obviously find the k element in A in order of n times. Describe order of log n Algorithm.
