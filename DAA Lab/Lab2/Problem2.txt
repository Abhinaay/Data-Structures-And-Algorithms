Problem2: Suppose you are given an array A[1..n] of sorted integers that has been circularly shifted k positions 
	  to the right. for example A[32,34,5,15,27,29] is sorted array that has been circularly shifted k=2 positions
	  while A[27,29,32,34,5,15] has been shifted k=4 positions.
	  We can obviously find the k element in A in order of n times. Describe order of log n Algorithm.
